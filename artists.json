The band has continued to authorise and release albums of previously unreleased material, best of collections, live albums and remixed projects. \r\n\r\nInducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 (Performer). \r\n\r\nAccording to the RIAA, the Beatles are the best-selling band in the United States, with 178 million certified units",
